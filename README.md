# SimASCII
SimASCII is a collection of physics-based visual simulations that run in real time inside the terminal, using ASCII characters to represent physical objects. Because of this approach, the simulations are simple and minimalistic by design.

Naturally, there are limitations to how much interesting behavior can be represented on a small discrete grid. While the simulations follow real physical laws, they are not really intended to produce practical or research-grade results. Instead, think of them as desk toys or, at best, pedagogical tools.

That said, they may still be useful for anyone interested in learning how physical laws can be implemented in code. For this reason, all source code is freely available.

### In the collection
- LJgas: A 2D gas in a box with Lennard-Jones interaction, by Kevin Restrepo.

Any contribution to make the collection bigger is more than welcome.
